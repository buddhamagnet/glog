kick
January 11th 2015
It’s a hard habit to maintain, keeping a diary. A few days have passed and I’ve just realised I’ve stopped again. But that’s OK. I’ve been reflecting, and a weird glacial metamorphosis has been taking place in my body and mind. I’m not drinking alcohol or coffee and haven’t smoked for three weeks. And a combination of ennui and exhilaration have combined to dominate my consciousness and attention. I’ve been monitoring myself intently and the process fascinates me. I finally started watching The Wire after all these years, pushing through the first few episodes and now I’m hooked. And there is a moment in the first season where a chronic junkie name of Bubbles gets, or tries to get, clean, and sits on a park bench as the real world rushes on his deadened senses. Green leaves and sunlight, women pushing prams, children laughing. But you know he won’t kick the habit, because he’ll get bored of the mundane.

And that’s how I feel. I’ve cut out all the vices, and I feel bored. I’m not flinching, I’m staring it down and letting it wash through me. This year I want to feel good in my physicality, but there’s a wall to climb first.

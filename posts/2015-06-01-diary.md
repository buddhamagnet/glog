phantasms

It feels like my entire physical universe is collapsing. Didn’t sleep well, my back feels like it has had a stake driven through it. Feeling generally low and devoid of energy. Been having the most weird dreams this week. Being served millipedes on a plate of pasta (very Cronenberg), all sorts of phantasms and unpleasant glimpses being driven by the engine of anxiety. My mission to get up early and frog march the three miles to the station was hamstrung by all this. But still no booze, no fags, no coffee. It’s a war of attrition.

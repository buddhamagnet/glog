Diary
January 4th 2015
No coffee, no booze, good food and I feel like Iâ€™ve been hit by a truck. We took the kids out to the local park this afternoon. It was cold, and a damp mist hung over the grass. Last day of the Christmas fair, a couple of dismal looking rides, an ice rink in a big top and a carousel, golden lights the only spark of colour in the intense and enervating gloom.

Now home, eating home made ham and lentil soup, reflecting on a weird year and wondering how weird 2015 will get.

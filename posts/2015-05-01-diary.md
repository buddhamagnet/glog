miasma

First day back with a full team and even though I am working from home you can taste the ennui. I had my first session of CBT this morning, focusing on social anxiety and I tried my damnedest to nail down my concerns in a simple model - situation, physical symptoms, emotions and behaviours. It felt a little odd to pick myself apart in such simple terms but the main reason I went down this route is to find practical solutions to a set of problems that is cutting me off from experiences I need and opportunities I can’t afford to miss. My task this week is to try and tease out some of the thought process around those situations. It’s a start, so let’s see how it goes.

I definitely need a fresh challenge and some raw energy in my life. Now I’ve cut out the booze and am getting a handle on my headspace, hopefully I’ll make my way out of this thick miasma soon and lit the touch paper.

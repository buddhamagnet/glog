I love how books and words have their own currents. I've known the name Dostoevsky all my life but never read a word - for some reason I feel the desire to fill this year with Russian literature so thought I'd start here.

Like many of his peers, this man has a reputation as a heavy hitter. So I was amazed (after finishing the first volume of In Search Of Lost Time by Proust) to find this immediately accessible, almost thriller-like in it's linguistic clarity, and engaging.

This, so far, does not seem to be an experiment with language. It is more a deep dive into the psychology of crime, fear and guilt, embedded in the sleaze and slum of nineteenth century St Petersburg. I'm already a third of the way through. Recommended.

boot
January 3rd 2015
Woke up this morning with the same dull ache in my sternum. Last year was pretty low if I’m honest - physically, emotionally and mentally. I let London chew me up, I let the percolating rage that seems to have infected every cell in my being control me like some spastic puppet. My head is full of wildfire and infinite ideas, but they are sealed off, frozen in my imagination. And I never used to live in an ivory tower, I engaged. I need to get that back. I am truly worried about my health but it feels like I’m worrying about the health of some acquaintance. I need to hook up with myself again.

Just finished a cup of green tea with Breton honey. The petrol gauge in the car appears to be a playing up so my first challenge is to try and make the garage with an indicator that says zero miles. Petrol can in back, waterproofs ready in case the gauge is in fact accurate. Wish me luck.
